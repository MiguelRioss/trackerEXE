- **Testing:** Mocha / Chai
- **Deployment:** Direct on Pi (systemd service)
- **Networking:** Tailnet secure VPN mesh
- **Tools:** VS Code, Git, CTT API

## ðŸ§© Features
- Automated CTT tracking and patch updates  
- Remote execution through Tailnet  
- Persistent connection and auto-restart service  
- Structured logging and error handling  
- Modular architecture separating logic and test environments  


## ðŸ§  Current Focus
- Improve CTT API reliability and rate-limit handling  
- Add notification system for failed deliveries  
- Build remote admin panel for live tracking control  

## ðŸ“¡ Notes
This project demonstrates remote backend operation on embedded hardware.  
It combines **Node.js automation** with **Tailnet connectivity** to create a lightweight, always-on distributed service.
